                            <p>You’ve heard that Singapore is boring, staid, inauthentic? No more. The island nation is shaking off the shackles of its ‘growth years’—the last 50—and bringing the focus to tourism. Visitors are coming in droves for the food scene, from hawkers to fine dining; cocktail culture (Atlas Bar has the world’s largest collection of gin); 
                                the shopping (practically a religion here); and some of the safest, cleanest city streets and subways we’ve ever seen.</p>
                            <p>From food to architecture, Singapore celebrates its melting pot of cultures, giving it a spark that makes it one of Asia's top destinations.</p>
